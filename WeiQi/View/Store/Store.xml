        <name>Yunzi Go Stones, Go Bowls Set</name>
        <desc>Yunzi is the national standard for professional tournaments in China. 
            Yunzi has a long history dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618 A.D. â€“ 907 A.D.) . 
            The stone has a property which absorbs moisture from one's fingertips without 
            picking up dirt, and a resonant quality that gives it a pleasing sound as it 
            lands on the board. Yunzi has a nice heft to it and is heavier than shell and 
            slate stones of equal size. 

            Choice of Chinese Style stones or Japanese Style stones. Please indicate your 
            preference. (Stones and bowls only. Go Board for illustration purposes only. )</desc>
